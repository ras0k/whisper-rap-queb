You wasn’t lying
You wasn’t lying
They not bout to ruin my day and steal my smile
You wasn’t lying
You wasn’t lying
They not bout to throw some shade and steal my shine
Black man brother black man
Rock and rolling with the homies ‘till the tombstone I’m
The groovy nigga with the jazz hands, ain’t gon hold you I be going through the blues sometimes, you think I’m staying low, better hold up, I’m trynna put the globe on my shoulders
“Holla if you feeling alright, we gon keep it jumping all night”
Give me sugar when I walk up in here
She get shook up when I’m all up in it
Take a picture I was cooling out with H and em
And we was never with the monkey business
Know they hate to see a brother blinging
Keep shining keep shining we diamonds we trynna see finer things ride with me, cause when my people’s is winning I get as happy as a scammer when his pieces is hitting
You wasn’t lying
You wasn’t lying
They not bout to ruin my day and steal my smile
You wasn’t lying
You wasn’t lying
They not bout to throw some shade and steal my shine
You wasn’t lying
You wasn’t lying
They not bout to ruin my day and steal my smile
You wasn’t lying
You wasn’t lying
They not bout to throw some shade and steal my shine
Now black women so fine yeah, so fine yeah, I ain’t never tell no lie, everybody and their mamas co-signs it, like hallelujah oh my god
I’ve been stressing for a blessing and I know y’all got it
When you flexing on them baby tell them “no I’m not sorry”
If they ever disrespect you tell them “hold that thought”
Then you play them like they Tetris when you throw that block “gon throw that block”
“Button and brush em, it’s nothing to you
You loving the function, go n bust a move
Your cup filled, my cup filled, let’s enjoy the groove
We just trynna play it cool, we don’t want no bad news”
My folks gon shine that’s the way it goes, and Stone gon smile ‘till the days over, you know I’m not lying to you, you know I’m not lying to you
You wasn’t lying
You wasn’t lying
They not bout to ruin my day and steal my smile
You wasn’t lying
You wasn’t lying
They not bout to throw some shade and steal my shine
