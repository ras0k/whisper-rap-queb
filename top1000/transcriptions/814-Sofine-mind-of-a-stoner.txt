Stoners live and stoners die
But in the end, we all get high
If in life you don't succeed
Just relax and smoke some weed
It all started in high school
That's when I thought, getting high was cool
I never saw it coming
Always played by the rules
Felt like I was trapped in a cage
With a demon on the loose
No way to ease the pain
Almost jumped off the roof
Bullied by the cool kids
They treated me like a goof
Crossed eye, new city, new school
Now put yourself in my shoes
They use to call me names
You don't even wanna know
Was this ever gonna change
Or should I end this on my own?
I had to find a cure
My mind was quite obscure
Remind myself I'm good
Took my conscious to the woods
Disconnect from the city life
Grind it, roll it, really nice
Find me smoking till it dies
No lie, so high, hypnotized
I spend time getting high
Whenever I feel sober
Hold on to that joint
The thrill is never over
Slower
Time's just an illusion
I'm still getting older
Living life as it is
With the mind of a stoner
Wipe the tears of my eyes
Yeah
My heart was filled with anger
Yeah
Living in constant fear
Yeah
I was mindless of the danger
Yeah
I carried so much pain
Yeah
I carried so much anger
Yeah
I can feel the heat rising
Yeah
My soul is on fire
Yeah
I had to find a cure
My mind was quite obscure
Remind myself I'm good
Took my conscious to the woods
Disconnect from the city life
Grind it, roll it, really nice
Find me smoking till it dies
No lie, so high, hypnotized
I spend time getting high
Whenever I feel sober
Hold on to that joint
The thrill is never over
Slower
Time's just an illusion
I'm still getting older
Living life as it is
With the mind of a stoner
Attracted by the smell
Where its from, how it grows
Round and round it goes
Where it stops, nobody knows
How does it feel like to get high?
A million stars in the sky
At an all-time high
From the first time, I got high
Every time I smoke one
I hit a new high
Ask me how I'm feeling
Now, you know why
Don’t give up on life
Don’t give up on your dreams
Don’t give up on yourself
Just relax and smoke some weed
