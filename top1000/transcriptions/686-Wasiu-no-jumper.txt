White man told me all I do is jump
Jump those expectations with the hugest dunk
Acing all my classes show them fools who dumb
I Better get a good review or view these nuts!
Said We only good for runnin now we run the game
They Still gon try to do you like a fuckin slave
Although they may disguise it in another name
But really what's the difference between love and hate?
They taking shots but they ain't got No Jumper
They taking shots at me but got No Jumper
I can build a building wit the bricks they missin
I can build a building wit the bricks they missin
SWISH
They taking shots but they ain't got No Jumper
Call they bluff cuz they ain't got my number
They ain't got my number
Shooting blanks like they don't need no rubber
They need me to son em
Oh my God u such a muthafucka wut a muthafucka
Stop the fables
U ain't wild dawg know the cops can tame u
They mock and shame you
Then plot to chase you
Run from the cannon nigga if they ketchup you a hot tomato
Shots are fatal
But my drive crazy like I'm not so stable
They try to stop me in my car like I'm Pac nigga
Not today though
God got my watch so I gotta take wrist
I don't care yall
Like I'm pleasuring a cloud, middle fingers in the air dawg
You can take your best shot but I bet it be an air ball
They taking shots but they ain't got no jumper
They taking shots at me but got no jumper
I can build a building wit the bricks they missin
I can build a building wit the bricks they missin
SWISH
That's me I'm on yo
Raining threes you need a poncho
We can go Mano a Mano
Nigga but I don't believe in your jumper: Bron or Rondo
That's cold like AC
Y'all slow like AC in that Bronco
Got the juice I'm in the Finals
Take a shot I got the bottles
Splash my brothers with the lotto
Hidden world we must unravel
Take a Rocket to Japan, Like James Harden we gon travel
Cook you in my frying pan, then I'm gone yo, Arigato
Basedgod please curse all of my foes
Cuz I need a sure shot when I'm going for the win
Like I'm on a trial and the jury white as shit
Ain't no doubt that im going to the pin
I plead no contest, I won't contest it cuz I know that's a miss
No Jumper, like a fake suicide threat-
There ain't no one on the bridge
They taking shots but they ain't got No Jumper
They taking shots at me but got No Jumper
I can build a building wit the bricks they missin
I can build a building wit the bricks they missin
