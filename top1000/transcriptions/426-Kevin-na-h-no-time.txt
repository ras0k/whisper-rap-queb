Baby, no time
Baby, no time
Baby, no time
Cause Imma do what I want
I'm gon' flex, on my ex
I'm gon' stun', I'm gon' shine
I'm gonn' give me a check
Before I die homie, yeah yeah yeah
Before I die homie, yeah yeah yeah
Cause Imma do what I want
I'm gon' flex, on my ex
I'm gon' stun', I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' give me a check
Before I die homie, yeah yeah yeah
Before I die homie, yeah yeah yeah
Before I die, Imma front
Before I die, Imma stun'
Imma eat Eggos for breakfast
Bitches down for lunch
The only thing I really care for
Are them ends I'm tryna tuck
They said the key is the patience
So I guess ain't none a rush
I can tell she have a crush
I can tell she wanna fuck
I can tell she not a thotty
I can tell she know wassup
I'm makin' something with no co-sign
I'm cookin' fire with these cold rounds
It's me and Quiet wasting no time
It's me and Quiet wasting no time
Baby, no time
Baby, no time
Baby, no time
Baby, no time
Baby, no time
Baby, no time
Baby, no time
Yeah
