Uh, yeah
The moonlight kept me safe when the problems rose
They ask me why I'm faded, I drown the noise
I'm swerving left and right dodging the potholes
The two door look like ice cream, Rocky Road
When I spend money, I lose control, yeah
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
Why do I still feel empty around these hoes?
And my bitch loves buying purses, no Michael Kors
To my pockets she's a burden, more and more
I'm trying to get high, to ignore the lows
Mon amour
I bought in the dream they sold me
No wonder I cling to poison
And they say if you blink it's over
I live fast so it's even shorter
Call up your friends, hop in the Benz
I put it in sport
Like a cinderella story
When 12 hit, I'm ghost
Yeah
The moonlight kept me safe when the problems rose
They ask me why I'm faded, I drown the noise
I'm swerving left and right dodging the potholes
The two door look like ice cream, Rocky Road
When I spend money, I lose control, yeah
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
Why do I still feel empty?
Ayy
Smoke, jump out the Bentley
Blues out their face, sour like they drank Simply
You got what it takes, them other girls envy
Askin' 'bout my old ways, but please don’t tempt me
She on board, and she gon' ride just like a 10 speed
Know I’m close to where the chips be
Keep a pole around, niggas mixy
Stashin' it like we don’t need no cash
Keep your business up out the streets, guarantee you see yo' bag
Yeah
The moonlight kept me safe when the problems rose
They ask me why I'm faded, I drown the noise
I'm swerving left and right dodging the potholes
The two door look like ice cream, Rocky Road
When I spend money, I lose control, yeah
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
Ayy, why do I still feel empty?
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
