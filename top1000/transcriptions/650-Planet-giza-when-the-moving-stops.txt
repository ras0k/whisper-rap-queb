And if I never sing again, let the record know I stood
10 toes in your city and took the neighborhood
A lot of people came and went, when the getting wasn’t good
Everybody wanna hang until they hanging out with suge
Heard he could’ve made the league but he wouldn’t leave to crooks
He was book smart now he needs some money on his books
Pardon my delay, I was in a daze
Ain’t no better time to go and bust a couple plays
In the universe the pendulum will swing both ways
So call up Mike Breen imma go out with a bang
I’m the water I’m the wave
Don’t you bother here to stay
I rose from the ashes and the shade
So ain’t gon be no bodies in my grave nigga
Need a genie in bottle yeah yeah
Take the lead and they gonna follow yeah yeah
When the moving stops are you gonna stop the motion?
I’m doing things I never thought of yeah yeah
Keep your dreams and keep your guard up yeah yeah
When the moving stops are you gonna stop the motion?
I fly to turks and Caicos with my BG
Been a hot boy since lil weezy wee
Juvenile deliquent I was broke and miskeen
Trying to take a hit at life but I missed when I swing
Trying to search for pay stubs, roaming these streets
Dodging all the answers even though that’s what I need
Bottom of the barrel I maneuver with the ease
You wouldn’t understand if you don’t look like me
I pop like semi-autos, to pop they
Come up with images I don’t buy those
Your stock drop, Stoney be kicking it with the models
The block hot, solar my system, I get them startled
Fighting with my vices watch me squabble
Need a genie in bottle yeah yeah
Take the lead and they gonna follow yeah yeah
When the moving stops are you gonna stop the motion?
I’m doing things I never thought of yeah yeah
Keep your dreams and keep your guard up yeah yeah
When the moving stops are you gonna stop the motion?
And then the sun came up
And then the sun came up
