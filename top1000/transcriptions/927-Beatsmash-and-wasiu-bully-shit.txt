Drop bombs, now I'm back on my Bully Shit, finna get blood on my hoodie shit
Black Gloves, black timbs, black skin, sun down, all black, now I'm full equipped
Dark night, now I feel like Batman, robbin' on the side, nigga got some fast hands
Bet your ankles, you can't walk where I stand, well bitch, shall we have this 'Last Dance'?
I am a god, bitch you can't guard me, Jesus wept but I drip like all leaks
Take a wrist-shot, see the ice playing hockey but I just ball like a meathead jockey
Stop Horsing around, bitch you not me, yea, I rose from the ground like I'm Rocky
Try to place me in a box, but I got creed, now all they do is watch, never stop me
Fuck a cop, I don't fuck with opps, unless she copping' cuffs for role play, I ain't cuffing thots, aye
I am not a player, I just fuck a lot, love me, but I love her not, fucking with a Juggernaut, aye
On the run, but always chasing bucks, while they countin' bloody money, getting papercuts
Nigga, Martin had a Dream but he ain't waking up, when our people do it right, they try erasing us, aye
I feel like I'm on Angel Dust, I was reaching for the stars but they got dangerous
Shit is never black and white but always racist huh?, shit is never black and white but always racist huh?, ts

Last dance, tik tok, time's ticking, 2-Step with the Devil in rhythm
Will you be the G.O.A.T or a victim?, beam on the side like Pippen
Coming for the top Like a climax, bitches thought that that was all I wanted, listen, I'm not finished
Breaking in and entering and climb that building and I'm firing a cannon, finna wild out nigga, aye
I'm not of this world, I'm a martian, Mars-Man, marking enemies to death, they be barking
Up the wrong tree, dawg I'm barking, wanna see me swinging from a tree, bitch I'm Tarzan
Wanna keep me hidden in the shadows, I'm a dark man
Now they'll never see me coming when I'm finna spark them, Arson
Superman, doing shit that Clark can't, Spartan, hit 'em in they chest till they heart jam, Harlem
Shake, shake to the grave, like an AK to the face
Bombs over Baghdad, cry first, have the last laugh, do it for those trapped behind bars or a #Hashtag
Tryna take mine, I'ma die for it, no looking back, keep my eyes forward
Back stabbers may try to hide ploys, slithering snakes, they can try, boy but first comes the Draco like Malfoy
Yeah, 2-Step with the Devil In Rhythm
2-Step with the Devil In Rhythm
Well bitch, shall we have this Last Dance?
