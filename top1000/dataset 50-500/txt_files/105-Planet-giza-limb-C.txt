more Can’t explain it I done been through it all My back right against the wall Trying to make sure I don’t fall Please I ain’t been around don’t fault Me Fighting off insecurities is harder than I thought And I really hope it don’t cost Me If you by my side don’t cross Me Cause even though it hurts I done been through worst I just need time
