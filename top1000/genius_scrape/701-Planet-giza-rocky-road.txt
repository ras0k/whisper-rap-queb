[Intro: Tony Stone]
Uh, yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus: Tony Stone]
The moonlight kept me safe when the problems rose (When the problems rose)
They ask me why I'm faded, I drown the noise
I'm swerving left and right dodging the potholes
The two door look like ice cream, Rocky Road (Look like ice cream)
When I spend money, I lose control, yeah
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
If I hit Follies, I might go broke (I might go broke)
Why do I still feel empty around these hoes? (Uh huh, ayy)

[Verse 1: Tony Stone]
And my bitch loves buying purses, no Michael Kors (Uh huh, ayy)
To my pockets she's a burden, more and more (More and more)
I'm trying to get high, to ignore the lows
Mon amour (Mon amour)
I bought in the dream they sold me (Uh huh)
No wonder I cling to poison (Uh huh)
And they say if you blink it's over (Uh huh)
I live fast so it's even shorter (Uh huh)
Call up your friends, hop in the Benz (Yeah, yeah)
I put it in sport (I put it in sport)
Like a cinderella story (Uh huh)
When 12 hit, I'm ghost
Yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus: Tony Stone & Cousin Stizz]
The moonlight kept me safe when the problems rose (When the problems rose)
They ask me why I'm faded, I drown the noise
I'm swerving left and right dodging the potholes
The two door look like ice cream, Rocky Road (Look like ice cream)
When I spend money, I lose control, yeah (Uh huh)
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
If I hit Follies, I might go broke (I might go broke)
Why do I still feel empty? (Ayy)
Ayy (Yeah)
(Empty)

[Verse 2: Cousin Stizz]
Smoke, jump out the Bentley (Bentley)
Blues out their face, sour like they drank Simply (Simply)
You got what it takes, them other girls envy (Envy)
Askin' 'bout my old ways, but please don’t tempt me (Ayy)
She on board, and she gon' ride just like a 10 speed (Woo)
Know I’m close to where the chips be (Yeah)
Keep a pole around, niggas mixy (Let's go, let's go)
Stashin' it like we don’t need no cash (Need, cash)
Keep your business up out the streets, guarantee you see yo' bag (See, yo' bag)

[Chorus: Tony Stone, Cousin Stizz & Tony Stone & Cousin Stizz]
Yeah (Yeah)
(Ayy)
The moonlight kept me safe when the problems rose (When the problems rose)
(Ayy)
They ask me why I'm faded, I drown the noise
I'm swerving left and right dodging the potholes
The two door look like ice cream, Rocky Road (Look like ice cream)
When I spend money, I lose control, yeah (Uh huh)
If I hit Follies, I might go broke
If I hit Follies, I might go broke (I might go broke)
Ayy, why do I still feel empty? (Empty, empty, empty, empty)

[Outro: Tony Stone]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
