[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Hey, look, hey

[Verse 1]
I'm toxic, I'm petty, I fuck her, forget it
She already wet, but my look made her wetter
The fit is real leather, my niggas equipped with the metal
Cause these niggas wan' get me set up
Fuck with me, get hit up
I fuck up a bag but it don't fuck my head up
I lock in, I get up
I take her develop, I touch it it's better
A touch of that guetto, 40g's of gelatto
I'm in a Gallardo, I'm bumpin Movado
She got a stallion, I got a saddle
She let me spit in her mouth and she swallow
Suck me like I might not be here tomorrow
That bitch she ain't mine, it's just my turn to borrow
But soon as I leave she fall for me like autumn
I just let her fall on my face with that bottom
And she gunna pick up up that phone if I call her

[Bridge]
Bitch, yeah
Bitch, yeah
Bitch, yeah
Bitch, yeah

[Chorus]
Bape on a plane, Gucci snakes on a plane
Spent eight on the bling for the hate on my name
Brought cake on the plane, I'm baked on the plane
Thirty thousand feet up from the hate on a plane
Diamonds in my watch, diamonds in my earring
What d'you think I'm dressing plain, cause I'm on a plane?
Got bae on the plane and the bae don't complain
When you this high up, you away from the rain

[Verse 2]
I'm here for me not nobody else
Cause they taking care of they own body
So I got me, only I stop me
Call my own shots and I'm uppin' the shotty
Get to the money, fuck the shawty
Only run from the, federally
Y'all already know, 'bout where I be
I'm from the dark, but I'm shinning (Uh, yea)
I felt like a milli when I had a thousand
Couldn't give a single what they think about me
All that I'm thinking about us what I'm counting (Uh, yea)
Fuck her I'm grabbing her neck
Were poppin' off but I ain't blow yet
Ice and cream but ain't sorbet
Free them boys gotta call collect
Pussy hole I saw your little threat
Yall's outside now you comin' out less
Ok, say less

[Chorus]
Bape on a plane, Gucci snakes on a plane
Spent eight on bling for the hate on my name
Brought cake on the plane, I'm baked on the plane
Thirty thousand feet up from the hate on a plane
Diamonds in my watch, diamonds in my earring
What d'you think I'm dressing plain, cause I'm on a plane?
Got bae on the plane and the bae don't complain
When you this high up, you away from the rain
