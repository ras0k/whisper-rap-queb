[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh (yeah, yeah)
I been thinkin', uh, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Tony Stone]
Been thinkin' maybe I ain't the player I thought I was (You know)
For the right face, I'm a lightweight, gotta keep my tolerance up (You know)
I be tryna catch myself right before I fall, no luck
That's why usually I'm super lowkey, I keep shit on the hush
But I'm askin' "Love, how I'm 'posed to not like your pictures?"
On every post, girl, you bad as fuck
And them stories got our inside joke
You know damn well that I'm swipin' up
She tryna blow my mind or somethin'
Outside just talkin', sittin' in my ride we hotboxin'
And I'm hypnotized by this shawty
Can not keep my eyes of here body
I ain't worried 'bout time when you 'round me
When you hit my line the world stops
She been on my mind, on my conscious
Even with my guard up, you got me
And I fuck with her vibe 'cause it's positive
Obvious I fall when you got all of it

[Chorus: Tony Stone]
I said you know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'
Oh, girl, you know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'
I said you know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'
Oh, girl, you know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'

[Post-Chorus: Tony Stone & Saba]
Tryna be a soldier, and keep my composure
But she got a cobra clutch on me
Every time we get closer, I can't focus
You know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin' (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Saba]
I think she knows what she doin'
Untie that shit like a loose end
Follow command, you like a lieutenant
I said "No" to them, but you can
Get me to change my mind, you two cent
I'm 'bout ready to offer you to move in
I had to take my plans and move them
Now the homie like "Ayy, bro who's your new friend?"
Who said you can look this good? I got shit to do
I'm 'bout to spend too much on shit I could give to you
Missed another appointment
She said "Miss me with little boy shit"
Before the game start, like a coin flip
Can't play both sides like a koi fish
And she not worried 'bout no old biz'
I think I'm addicted like the shit opium
She a movie star, I'm 'bout to get it on film
She do everything that she intends
I atten-hut, lockdown what you in for
She told me to clear the actin' innocent, but

[Chorus: Tony Stone]
I said you know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'
Oh, girl, you know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'
I said you know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'
Oh, girl, you know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'

[Post-Chorus: Tony Stone]
Tryna be a soldier, and keep my composure
But she got a cobra clutch on me
Every time we get closer, I can't focus
You know just what you doin'
You know just what you doin'

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
