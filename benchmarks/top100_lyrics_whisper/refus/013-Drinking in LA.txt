Hi, my name is Stereo Mike.
Yeah, we got three tickets to the Brand Van concert
happening this Monday night at the Pacific Palisades.
You can all log in if you want to answer a couple of questions.
Mainly, what is Todd's favorite cheese?
Jackie just called and said it was a form of rockcore.
Let's see if we can add it.
Give us a ring-ding-ding.
It's a beautiful day.
Yeah, Todd, this is Liquid.
Ring-a-ding-a-ding-a.
I want those three Brand Van tickets, man.
Todd.
You're alive.
Alive.
Todd.
I woke up again this morning with the sun in my eyes
When Mike came over with a script surprise
A mafioso story with a twist
A two-word food joke
Who you are here to get your ass out of bed
He said, I was planning on the way
But we did nothing
Absolutely nothing that day
And I said, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A.?
That's what he said, babe
I got the fever for the flavor
The day that's over, babe
Until I'm in a fit, babe
And the girls on the bus kept on laughing at us
We're all drunk, tanned, down in Venice again
Blaring out the G-funk, sipping on a G-City
Just me and a friend
Feeling catagorically working on a movie
Yeah, right
But we did nothing
Absolutely nothing that day
And I'll say, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A.?
That's what he said, babe
Put my mind on my money and my money on mine
Yeah, yeah
I got a private storm I'm taking
So I better rise up and take it quick
Yeah, one more time, the trade of it's
When some men, they don't want it to hurt us
And other men say we weren't worth the fuss
You can see them all bitching by the bar
Above the fine line
Between the rich and the poor
They might turn to me and say
What you think we got done, son?
We've found the conclusion
And I guess that's something
So I ask you, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A.?
That's what he said, babe
I got the fever, full of nectar
The pain that's moving later
Until I'm in a fit, babe
Yeah, it's fixed, yeah, well
Come here Wednesday, and we'll fix it
L.A., L.A., L.L.A., L.L.A., L.L.A., L.L.A., L.L.A., L.L.A., L.L.A., L.L.A., L.L.A.
So I ask you, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A.?
That's what he said, babe
He's a liar
A liar?
Yeah, that's my first job, right?
