I will not say that I have seen everything brother but I know that nothing fascinates me anymore
Everyday the impression that the police listens to my conversations
You heard 514 everywhere in the city
I make coke in the street to be able to invest in my passion
My guys braked just for a salary
Just a guy from the street who dreamed of being a rapper
Tell me, where were you when I was in trouble
You will have a good time, run away, but you will always be there
In the hood, the little ones are all armed, it does not solve the problems like the old one
Just there for a few years and already we put the rap game in quarantine
My feelings are packed, the drug is cut and well detailed
And if the war is declared, prepared, I fucked my 45
More confident
Without his son of a bitch
I take care of those who leave, I trust those who say less
Dollars fell, ten more
Friends, you may have ten less
I am determined, I am calibrated
Your favorite rapper, come validate us
I don't know who are my enemies and who are my allies
The team in the alleys, the drug in the luggage
I braked to calm my desires
Victory in appearances, betrayal will come from the one who seems kinder
All became bandits
Just for liasses
Now I grew up, I don't want millions, I want billions
I will not say that I saw everything, brother, but I know that nothing fascinates me anymore
Every day the impression that the police listen to my conversations
You heard 514 everywhere in the city
I make coke in the street to be able to invest in my passion
My guys braked, they say just for a salary
Just a guy in the street who dreamed of being a rapper
Tell me, were you or when I was in trouble
You will have a good time, run away, we will always be together
I had the choice to deal and the pockets full of bills
The pride of my mother, that's all I wanted
I saw the time pass, my life got worse
If the blood was flowing, it was only money that was rolling
No, you have no idea, we can hide you
For money, happy or just for pleasure
All grown up in hard times
There is only in the street that the wolf eats the chicken
When I was told
Do not listen to all these faggots, all these pathetic rappers
If you clash your team
We just come to roll, we blow you, you do not know who it is
We have to get out of here
That you are down in size, you think that the street is beautiful
A fence that is flattened, it is with the souls that the stories are clarified
Clarify, clarify
The stories are clarified, clarified, clarified
The stories are clarified
The stories are clarified, clarified
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I will not say that I saw everything, brother, but I know that nothing is easier
Every day the impression that the police listen to my conversations
You heard 514 everywhere in the city
I make coke in the street to be able to invest in my passion
I will not say that I saw everything, brother, but I know that nothing is easier
I will not say that I saw everything, brother, but I know that nothing is easier
Every day the impression that the police listen to my conversations
I will not say that I saw everything, brother, but I know that nothing is easier
Every day the impression that the police listen to my conversations
You heard 514 everywhere in the city
I make coke in the street to be able to invest in my passion
My guys brak, and I say just for a salary
My guys brak, and I say just for a salary
Just a man from the street who wanted to be a rapper
Just a man from the street who wanted to be a rapper
Just a man from the street who wanted to be a rapper
Tell me where. Tú was where when I was in trouble
Tell me where. Tú was where when I was in trouble
T'auras beau temps fur la monstra Toujours à l'heure
