Oh
Feel on par beat, suck is a bitch
I'm sick, sick, sick of standing
Sick, sick, sick, sick
I'm sick, sick, sick of standing
Piel, Gogo, Piel, Combo
I came to sell a dance
The guy thought that was what it was
But it wasn't what it was, bounce
Sucker
But it wasn't what it was, step
People tell you that you eat and you're cold
The critic complains, the bench
Air ticket for his friend
Bring a mojito, it's not that bad
We're going to walk in Bethesda
Oxygen, food for the guys for the week
The guy thought that was what it was, step
Dancing to the beat of the beat
My boy, this is basic
10 digits, delivery in our house
Good business
I'm the neighbor of everyone
The grass is always greener than the neighbor
I'm the neighbor of everyone
The grass is always greener than the neighbor
Always greener than the neighbor
Make me some bread, baby, make the maize
Make the cutlets, and put some butter
Make the doublés, and put some mithun
Make the triplets, and I call it a bread
It's not bad, I'm the one who's the best
It's not bad, I'm the one who's the best
You think that's what it is
That's what it is
You think that's what it is
That's what it is
You think that's what it is
That's what it is
You think that that's what it is
You think that's what it is
You think that's what this is
That's what it is
You think that's what it is
You think that's what it is
You think that's what this is
You think that's what this is
You think that's what this is
You think that's what this is
That's what this is
It's just mouth g dish in the streets
A little more fanatic in the Genesis
It's right through the B, it was based on the C
Tu finis d'enlever
Tu me dises dans ton tchat que c'est sur l'illuminale
Vu que t'es incommunable
C'est comme bête et tu caches sur le gars qui fait des push-ups
À une main sur mon royal
Une image vaut mille mots mais les tiens ils pèsent à rien pour toi
Fait que dans la balance y'aurait même pas 500 sous
Tu retournes à laver des blanches, j'ai très bien dit
Un clip, un pourboire, un conseil
Reste mince, ferme ta gueule, tires
Pis parle plus jamais de mon bruit
Vis ta vie de bloc
De mode cesse ton rap de gonzesse
T'as ça que dit au complet
Quand t'as dit que t'as fait un bon bref
