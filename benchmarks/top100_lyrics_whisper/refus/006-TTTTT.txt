Yeah, they call my name every Friday
We arrive, we go back in time to say it
We take the bar and the money from the bar
Then we take the bar, my kind of deal
We named it X, we aimed it right
We made a cross on the little Jesus
The count of my nights, I put one
I haven't seen the sun since the moons
But we need what we need for the clientele
We would have served the clientele
Leave feathers on hotel beds
Crazy stories I can't even tell
Leave my wife at home, so much in my zone
There are months I haven't said I love you
But these things, they take time
These things, they take time
I hear the crowd asking for a call
And I write, I hope it was worth it
I can't talk, I call you later
I can't talk, I call you later
We made the war, we made the peace
We made love, I barely remember
I need to learn to reconnect
But these things, they take time
Suddenly desire to burn the bridges
To wash my hands and throw the sponges
I failed, I failed
And shoot at the gun
distortion
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
Better do what you gotta go
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
Make room, go!
New album, we renegotiate
One day, record, then the year will follow
We take our attention for two months
We disappear again, you know our style
We shoot once, we reach our targets
We do our best to do the impossible
But these things, they take time
These things, they take time
We have big weeks, we find sleep when the sun rises
Bury my head in the sun
Bury my head in the sun
I start shooting in all directions
I think my conscience is playing tricks on me
I stop smoking every day
But these things, they take time
Oh yeah, I know the big classics
It's always complicated, easy money
It's been two, three years, I'm waiting for my boy
It seems he's stuck in traffic
Since the Volvo slipped
Five years a boy in therapy
Sometimes I feel like I haven't learned anything
But these things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
These things, they take time
Thank you.
Thank you.
